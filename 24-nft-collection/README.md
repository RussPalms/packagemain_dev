## packagemain #24: Generate an NFT Collection in Go

Nowadays almost any conversation will inevitably end up with discussing NFTs or non-fungible tokens. However, I'm not going to talk about it much today, as I am not an expert. I will rather focus on a technical part of generating a collection of unique images by blending the layers in Go. That should be fun. And probably later if I gain more knowledge in this space we can "mint" them as well.
